## Report a security issue or vulnerability

The bottle-time-processor team welcomes security reports and is committed to
providing prompt attention to security issues. Security issues should be
reported privately via [envoys-radius3t@icloud.com][support-email]. Security issues should
not be reported via the public GitHub Issue tracker.

## Security advisories

The project team is committed to transparency in the security issue disclosure
process. The bottle-time-processor team announces security advisories through our
Github respository's [security portal][sec-advisories] and and the
[RustSec advisory database][rustsec-db].
